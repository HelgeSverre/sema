# Publish all crates to crates.io when a version tag is pushed.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Bump the version in Cargo.toml (workspace.package.version + dependency pins)
#   2. Commit and push
#   3. Tag and push:  git tag v1.6.2 && git push origin v1.6.2
#
# Setup:
#   Add your crates.io API token as a secret named CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN in
#   github.com/helgesverre/sema → Settings → Secrets → Actions
#
# The crates are published in dependency order with delays between each
# to avoid crates.io rate limits and allow index propagation.
