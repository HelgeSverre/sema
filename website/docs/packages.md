# Package Manager

::: warning Registry Status
The central package registry (`pkg.sema-lang.com`) is not yet live. **Git-based packages work today** — you can install any package directly from a git repository. Registry commands (`search`, `info`, `publish`, `yank`, `login`) require a registry instance; see [Self-Hosted Registry](#self-hosted-registry) to run your own.
:::

Sema supports two package sources: a **package registry** (for published packages with semver versions) and **direct git repos** (for development branches, private code, or unregistered packages). Both can be mixed freely in the same project.

## Package Format

A package is a directory containing at minimum one of:

- **`package.sema`** — the default entrypoint (what gets loaded on import)
- **`sema.toml`** — optional package metadata, dependencies, and custom entrypoint

### `sema.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "my-package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A useful Sema library"
entrypoint = "lib.sema"

[deps]
# Registry packages — short name = version
http-helpers = "1.0.0"
json-schema = "2.1.0"

# Git packages — quoted URL = git ref
"github.com/user/private-lib" = "main"
```

The `[package]` section defines metadata:

| Field         | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Package name                                      |
| `version`     | Semver version string (required for publishing)   |
| `description` | Short description of the package                  |
| `entrypoint`  | File loaded on import (default: `package.sema`)   |

The `[deps]` section maps package identifiers to versions or git refs:

- **Keys without `/`** are registry packages (e.g., `http-helpers`)
- **Keys with `/`** are git packages (e.g., `"github.com/user/repo"`)

### Entrypoint Resolution

When you import a package, Sema resolves the entrypoint in this order:

1. **Direct file** — `~/.sema/packages/<spec>.sema` (for sub-module imports like `github.com/user/repo/utils`)
2. **Custom entrypoint** — if `sema.toml` exists and has an `entrypoint = "..."` field, that file is loaded
3. **Default entrypoint** — `package.sema` in the package directory

## CLI Commands

### `sema pkg init`

Initialize a new project in the current directory. Creates a `sema.toml` with the directory name as the package name.

```bash
mkdir my-package && cd my-package
sema pkg init
```

This creates both `sema.toml` (with `entrypoint = "package.sema"`) and a starter `package.sema` file. If `package.sema` already exists, only the manifest is created.

### `sema pkg add`

Add a package from the registry or a git repository.

```bash
# Registry packages (short names)
sema pkg add http-helpers            # latest version
sema pkg add http-helpers@1.0.0      # specific version

# Git packages (URL paths)
sema pkg add github.com/user/repo          # latest default branch (main)
sema pkg add github.com/user/repo@v1.2.0   # specific tag
sema pkg add github.com/user/repo@main     # specific branch
```

The source is auto-detected: if the first path segment contains a dot (looks like a hostname), it's treated as a git URL. Otherwise, it's looked up on the configured registry.

You can override the registry with `--registry`:

```bash
sema pkg add http-helpers --registry https://my-registry.com
```

If a `sema.toml` exists in the current directory, the package is automatically added to the `[deps]` section. If no `sema.toml` exists, one is created automatically with the package added to `[deps]`.

### `sema pkg install`

Fetch all dependencies listed in `sema.toml`.

```bash
sema pkg install
sema pkg install --locked    # fail if sema.lock is missing or out of sync (for CI)
```

Reads the `[deps]` section and fetches each dependency — routing to the registry or git based on the key format (see [sema.toml](#sema-toml) above). Requires a `sema.toml` in the current directory.

When a `sema.lock` file exists, locked entries are installed at their exact pinned versions with integrity verification (commit SHA for git, SHA256 checksum for registry). Dependencies not yet in the lock file are resolved fresh and appended. Orphaned lock entries (in lock but not in `sema.toml`) are pruned automatically.

The `--locked` flag enforces strict reproducibility for CI:
- Fails if `sema.lock` is missing
- Fails if any dep in `sema.toml` is not in the lock (or vice versa)
- Fails if the version/ref in `sema.toml` doesn't match the lock entry
- Never resolves fresh — only installs from lock

### `sema pkg update`

Update installed packages to their latest versions.

```bash
sema pkg update                       # update all installed packages
sema pkg update http-helpers          # update a specific registry package
sema pkg update github.com/user/repo  # update a specific git package
sema pkg update repo                  # update by short name
```

- **Registry packages** check for a newer version and re-download if available
- **Git packages** fetch from origin and pull the latest changes

Both `sema.toml` and `sema.lock` are updated to reflect the new versions.

### `sema pkg remove`

Remove an installed package from the global cache, `sema.toml`, and `sema.lock`.

```bash
sema pkg remove http-helpers          # registry package
sema pkg remove github.com/user/repo  # git package by full path
sema pkg remove repo                  # by short name
```

### `sema pkg list`

List all installed packages with their version/ref and source.

```bash
sema pkg list
```

```
  http-helpers (1.0.0) [https://pkg.sema-lang.com]
  github.com/user/repo (v1.2.0) [git]
  github.com/user/utils (main) [git]
```

### `sema pkg search`

Search the registry for packages.

```bash
sema pkg search http
sema pkg search json --registry https://my-registry.com
```

```
Found 3 packages:

  http-helpers — HTTP client utilities for Sema
  http-server — Simple HTTP server framework
  http-mock — HTTP mocking for tests
```

### `sema pkg info`

Show detailed package information from the registry.

```bash
sema pkg info http-helpers
```

```
http-helpers
  HTTP client utilities for Sema
  repo: https://github.com/user/http-helpers
  owners: alice, bob

  Versions:
    2.0.0 — 12480 bytes, 2026-02-20T10:30:00Z
    1.1.0 — 11200 bytes, 2026-01-15T08:00:00Z
    1.0.0 — 9800 bytes, 2025-12-01T12:00:00Z
```

### `sema pkg publish`

Publish the current package to the registry. Requires a `sema.toml` with `[package]` containing `name` and `version`, and an active login.

```bash
sema pkg publish
sema pkg publish --registry https://my-registry.com
```

```
Packaging...
  24576 bytes compressed
✓ Published http-helpers@1.0.0 (24576 bytes, sha256:abc123...)
```

### `sema pkg yank`

Yank a published version to prevent new installs (existing installs are unaffected).

```bash
sema pkg yank http-helpers@1.0.0
```

### `sema pkg login`

Authenticate with a package registry by providing an API token.

```bash
sema pkg login --token sema_pat_...                          # default registry
sema pkg login --token sema_pat_... --registry https://...   # self-hosted
```

Tokens are stored in `~/.sema/credentials.toml` with `0600` file permissions. You can generate a token from your registry account page.

### `sema pkg logout`

Remove stored registry credentials.

```bash
sema pkg logout
```

### `sema pkg config`

View or set package manager configuration. Currently supports `registry.url` to change the default registry.

```bash
sema pkg config                                           # show all config
sema pkg config registry.url                              # show current registry URL
sema pkg config registry.url https://my-registry.com      # set default registry
```

```
registry.url = https://pkg.sema-lang.com
registry.token = (set)

Credentials file: /Users/you/.sema/credentials.toml
```

## Lock File (`sema.lock`)

The `sema.lock` file records the exact resolved version of every dependency for reproducible builds. It is auto-generated and should be committed to version control.

### Format

```toml
# sema.lock — auto-generated, do not edit manually
lock_version = 1

[packages."github.com/user/repo"]
source = "git"
ref = "main"
commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd"

[packages."http-helpers"]
source = "registry"
version = "1.2.0"
registry = "https://pkg.sema-lang.com"
checksum = "abc123def456789..."
```

- **Git packages** record the `ref` (branch/tag) and exact `commit` SHA
- **Registry packages** record the `version`, `registry` URL, and SHA256 `checksum` of the downloaded tarball

### How It Works

| Command | Lock behavior |
|---------|--------------|
| `sema pkg add` | Installs and writes/updates lock entry |
| `sema pkg install` | Installs from lock when available; resolves and appends for unlocked deps; prunes orphaned entries |
| `sema pkg install --locked` | Installs from lock only; fails on any mismatch (for CI) |
| `sema pkg update` | Re-resolves to latest and rewrites lock + manifest |
| `sema pkg remove` | Removes package, manifest entry, and lock entry |

### Integrity Verification

When installing from a lock file:
- **Git packages** are checked out at the pinned commit using `git checkout --detach`. The resulting HEAD is verified against the lock.
- **Registry packages** are downloaded and their SHA256 checksum is compared against the lock. A mismatch produces a clear error.

### CI Usage

Use `--locked` in CI pipelines to guarantee reproducible builds:

```bash
sema pkg install --locked
```

This will fail with an actionable error if:
- `sema.lock` doesn't exist
- A dependency was added to `sema.toml` but not locked
- A dependency version/ref changed in `sema.toml` without re-locking
- An orphaned entry exists in the lock

## Importing Packages

Import a package by its URL path (git packages) or short name (registry packages):

```sema
;; Git package
(import "github.com/user/string-utils")
(string-utils/slugify "Hello World")
; => "hello-world"

;; Registry package
(import "http-helpers")
(http-helpers/fetch "https://api.example.com")
```

The package name (last segment of the URL, or the short name) becomes the namespace prefix. You can also use selective imports:

```sema
(import "github.com/user/string-utils" (slugify titlecase))

(slugify "Hello World")
; => "hello-world"
```

### Sub-module Imports

You can import sub-modules from a package by appending a path:

```sema
;; Resolves to ~/.sema/packages/github.com/user/repo/utils.sema
(import "github.com/user/repo/utils")
```

### How Sema Distinguishes Package vs File Imports

An import string is treated as a **package import** when it:
- Contains `/` (path separator)
- Does **not** start with `./` or `../` (relative path)
- Does **not** end with `.sema` (explicit file)
- Is **not** an absolute path

Otherwise, it's resolved as a relative file import from the current file's directory.

```sema
;; Package imports
(import "github.com/user/repo")        ; → ~/.sema/packages/github.com/user/repo/package.sema
(import "github.com/user/repo/utils")  ; → ~/.sema/packages/github.com/user/repo/utils.sema

;; File imports (relative to current file)
(import "./helpers.sema")              ; relative file
(import "../lib/utils.sema")           ; parent directory
```

## On-Disk Layout

Packages are cached globally at `~/.sema/packages/`, with different structures for registry and git packages:

```
~/.sema/
  credentials.toml              # registry token + URL
  history.txt                   # REPL history
  packages/
    http-helpers/               # registry package (short name)
      .sema-pkg.json            # source metadata
      sema.toml
      package.sema
    github.com/                 # git packages (URL structure)
      user/
        repo/
          .git/
          sema.toml
          package.sema
```

Registry packages include a `.sema-pkg.json` metadata file that tracks the source, version, registry URL, and checksum. This file is managed automatically by the package manager.

## Creating a Package

### 1. Initialize

```bash
mkdir sema-csv-utils && cd sema-csv-utils
sema pkg init
```

### 2. Write Your Code

Edit the generated `package.sema` to define your package's API:

```sema
;; package.sema — package entrypoint
(defun parse-row (line)
  (map string/trim (string/split line ",")))

(defun parse-csv (text)
  (map parse-row (string/split text "\n")))
```

### 3. Add Dependencies (Optional)

```bash
sema pkg add http-helpers@1.0.0
```

This fetches the package and adds it to your `sema.toml` automatically. Then use it in your code:

```sema
(import "http-helpers")

(defun fetch-csv (url)
  (parse-csv (:body (http-helpers/get url))))
```

### 4. Publish

#### To the Registry

Ensure your `sema.toml` has `name` and `version` in the `[package]` section, then:

```bash
sema pkg login --token sema_pat_...
sema pkg publish
```

Others can now install your package:

```bash
sema pkg add sema-csv-utils@0.1.0
```

#### Via Git (No Registry)

Push to a public git repository. Tag releases with semver:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

Others can install directly from git:

```bash
sema pkg add github.com/yourname/sema-csv-utils@v0.1.0
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a new project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
sema pkg init

# Add dependencies (mix of registry and git)
sema pkg add http-helpers@2.0.0
sema pkg add github.com/user/json-schema@v1.1.0

# Install everything (if cloning the project fresh)
sema pkg install           # generates/updates sema.lock

# In CI, use --locked for reproducibility
sema pkg install --locked

# List what's installed
sema pkg list

# Search for packages
sema pkg search csv

# Check package details
sema pkg info csv-parser
```

```sema
;; main.sema
(import "http-helpers")
(import "github.com/user/json-schema")

(def response (http-helpers/fetch "https://api.example.com/data"))
(def valid? (json-schema/validate schema (json/decode (:body response))))
(println (if valid? "Valid!" "Invalid."))
```

```bash
sema main.sema
```

## Self-Hosted Registry

Sema's package registry is designed to be self-hostable. The registry server ships in the [`pkg/`](https://github.com/helgesverre/sema/tree/main/pkg) directory of the Sema repository — it's a single Rust binary backed by SQLite that serves both a web UI and a REST API. See its [README](https://github.com/helgesverre/sema/tree/main/pkg#readme) for build and deployment instructions.

To point the CLI at your own registry instance:

```bash
# Set as default registry
sema pkg config registry.url https://registry.mycompany.com

# Or per-command
sema pkg add my-internal-lib --registry https://registry.mycompany.com
sema pkg publish --registry https://registry.mycompany.com
```

All `sema pkg` commands that interact with the registry accept a `--registry` flag to override the default.

## Troubleshooting

### "package not found"

```
Error: package not found: github.com/user/repo
Hint: Run: sema pkg add github.com/user/repo
```

The package hasn't been fetched yet. Run the suggested command to install it.

### "invalid package spec: URL schemes not allowed"

```
Error: invalid package spec: URL schemes not allowed: https://github.com/user/repo
```

Use the bare host/path format without `https://`:

```bash
# ✗ Wrong
sema pkg add https://github.com/user/repo

# ✓ Correct
sema pkg add github.com/user/repo
```

### "invalid package spec: path traversal not allowed"

The package path contains `..`, `.`, or empty segments. Package paths must be clean, forward-slash-separated identifiers like `github.com/user/repo`.

### "No sema.toml found"

`sema pkg install` requires a `sema.toml` in the current directory. Run `sema pkg init` to create one, or `cd` to the project root.

### "Not logged in"

Publishing and yanking require authentication. Run `sema pkg login --token <token>` with a token from your registry account page.

### "sema.lock not found" (with `--locked`)

`sema pkg install --locked` requires a `sema.lock` file. Run `sema pkg install` (without `--locked`) first to generate it, then commit the lock file to version control.

### "version mismatch" (with `--locked`)

You changed a version/ref in `sema.toml` without re-locking. Run `sema pkg install` to update `sema.lock`, then commit both files.

### "Lock integrity error"

The downloaded package doesn't match the checksum or commit recorded in `sema.lock`. This can happen if a registry re-published a version with different contents or a git tag was force-pushed. Run `sema pkg update <name>` to re-resolve and update the lock.

### "git clone/fetch failed"

The package URL couldn't be reached. Check that:
- The repository exists and is public (or you have git credentials configured)
- The git ref (tag/branch) exists on the remote
- You have network access
