# Lisp Dialect Benchmark

How does Sema compare to other Lisp dialects on a real-world I/O-heavy workload? This page benchmarks fifteen Lisp dialects on the [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) — read weather-station measurements and compute min/mean/max per station. It is not a synthetic micro-benchmark; it exercises I/O, string parsing, hash-table accumulation, and numeric aggregation in a tight loop.

::: warning A benchmark ranks implementations, not just runtimes
After a 2026-06-20 fairness pass, every dialect's **optimized** entry uses a comparable best effort — a hand-rolled integer×10 temperature parser and, where it helps the runtime, block/byte I/O. Even then, results partly reflect *how each program was written*, not pure runtime throughput. The [dialect notes](#dialect-notes) say where each number comes from; the [simple table](#simple-idiomatic) shows the same workload written the obvious way.

## Benchmark

One same-machine run: **macOS 15.6, Apple M2 Max, native Homebrew runtimes, 10,000,000 rows (~124 MiB), best of 3, single-threaded** (2026-06-20). Sema is the **v1.19.2 PGO build**. All fifteen implementations produce byte-identical output. PicoLisp is omitted — no native Homebrew formula.

### Optimized — best effort per dialect

Each implementation tuned to a comparable level (hand-rolled int×10 parser; block/byte I/O where the runtime benefits). Relative to the fastest (Fennel).

| **Kawa**          | 18,395    | 34.6x    | JVM (JIT)            |

### Simple / idiomatic

The same workload written the obvious way in each dialect — built-in number parser, per-line I/O, standard data structures. No hand-rolled parsers, no block reads. Closer to "raw runtime on naive code." Relative to the fastest (Gambit).

| Dialect           | Time (ms) | Relative |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Gambit**        | 2,351     | 1.0x     |
| **Chez Scheme**   | 2,481     | 1.1x     |
| **Fennel/LuaJIT** | 2,679     | 1.1x     |
| **Clojure**       | 2,902     | 1.2x     |
| **SBCL**          | 2,997     | 1.3x     |
| **Guile**         | 5,186     | 2.2x     |
| **newLISP**       | 8,206     | 3.5x     |
| **Chicken**       | 9,094     | 3.9x     |
| **Janet**         | 9,950     | 4.2x     |
| **Sema**          | 10,026    | 4.3x     |
| **ECL**           | 13,599    | 5.8x     |
| **Emacs Lisp**    | 16,219    | 6.9x     |
| **Gauche**        | 16,476    | 7.0x     |
| **Kawa**          | 17,793    | 7.6x     |

The gap between the two tables is itself the story. Where optimized ≪ simple (Fennel, Racket, Janet, Gauche), most of the win came from a hand-rolled parser or block I/O. Where they're close (Clojure, Sema, newLISP), the runtime was already doing the work and there was little left to hand-tune.

## Dialect notes

What's behind each number — and which results are runtime ceilings versus implementation choices.

### Fennel / LuaJIT — the JIT runs away with it

Fennel compiled to LuaJIT is **the fastest entry, ahead of SBCL** (532 ms). LuaJIT's tracing JIT compiles the hot byte-scan loop to native code; with a `string.byte` integer parser and 1 MiB block reads it chews through ~250 MB/s. It's the clearest "runtime does the heavy lifting" result — but note its *simple* version is 2.7 s (5× slower), so the win is the optimized byte loop being unusually JIT-friendly, not a free lunch.

### SBCL — native code + `(safety 0)`

SBCL compiles to native machine code; in a type-specialized hot path there is no interpreter loop. With `(declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)))`, block `read-sequence` I/O, an integer×10 parser, and in-place `setf` struct mutation, the inner loop runs near C speed. 25+ years of compiler work (descended from CMUCL). Its 1.3× → 1.0x optimization gain (simple 3.0 s → optimized 0.9 s) is the largest in the suite.

### Racket — block I/O closes the gap

After the fairness pass, Racket reads 1 MiB byte blocks, scans for `;`/newline with O(1) `subbytes` slicing, and parses int×10 — **2.2× faster than the naive `read-line` + `string->number` version** (3.5 s → 1.4 s), jumping ahead of Chez. Racket's CS backend (Chez under the hood) plus byte strings make the tuned version genuinely fast.

### Chez Scheme — the other native compiler

Chez compiles to native code via a [nanopass framework](https://nanopass.org/). With a custom char-by-char parser and `make-hashtable`/`string-hash` it lands just behind Racket. The remaining gap to SBCL is mostly per-line string allocation versus SBCL's block parser.

### Gambit — compiled Scheme via C

`gsc` compiles Scheme to C to a native binary. It got the same int×10 parser as the other Schemes, but the win was negligible here — `read-line` + `substring` + string hashing dominate the loop, so I/O, not number parsing, is the bottleneck.

### Clojure — JVM tax + warmup

Clojure's time includes JVM startup and JIT warmup, real costs for a single-shot script. `line-seq` + a transient map is idiomatic but not zero-cost, and `Double/parseDouble` handles the full IEEE-754 spec. Steady-state throughput is better than the wall-clock suggests; it trades raw speed for compactness.

### Guile — Scheme bytecode VM + JIT

Guile 3 has a bytecode VM with a native JIT on supported platforms. With a hand-rolled int×10 parser it's the fastest of the "VM" tier here, ahead of Janet and Chicken.

### Janet — the closest architectural peer

Janet is the most architecturally comparable to Sema: an embeddable scripting language, bytecode VM, GC-based, no native compiler. The honest result after tuning both fairly: **Janet (5.0 s) is ~1.6× faster than Sema (8.1 s)**. Two things help Janet here — its strings *are* byte strings (O(1) slicing, no UTF-8 navigation), and it has a tracing GC instead of `Rc` reference counting, so a `slurp` + byte-scan + int parser goes a long way. This is the comparison to watch as Sema's runtime evolves.

### Chicken — compiled Scheme, I/O bound

Chicken compiles Scheme to C via `csc -O3` with an int×10 parser. The remaining gap is per-line I/O allocation and Chicken's continuation-passing-style C ("Cheney on the MTA"), whose trampolining the C compiler can't fully optimize away.

### Gauche — a mature runtime the naive idiom hid

The original Gauche entry (16.7 s, near the bottom) was an artifact, not a runtime limit. Gauche stores strings as **UTF-8 indexed by character**, so the naive `substring`/`string-index` per row paid O(k) navigation to convert character positions to byte offsets. Reading the whole file into a `u8vector` and scanning **bytes** + an int×10 parser cut it **2.4× to 7.2 s** — mid-pack, ahead of Sema. A good reminder that a benchmark can badly under-represent a mature, well-engineered runtime if the implementation plays to its one weakness.

### Sema — the interpreter floor

Honest placement: Sema (8.1 s) sits behind a properly-tuned Gauche, Janet, Chicken, and Guile. It's a bytecode interpreter with NaN-boxed immutable values and `Rc` reference counting — no JIT, no native codegen. The v1.19.2 build (fat LTO + PGO + inline opcodes) moved it from ~11 s to 8.1 s, and the implementation is now at the **interpreter floor**: the tricks that helped the compiled dialects don't transfer — Sema's native `string/split` and `string->float` already beat any interpreted hand-parser (measured), and vectors are immutable with no mutable cell, so every row must rebuild the stat vector. The next real gains are *runtime*, not implementation: a **tracing GC** (kills the per-row `Rc` churn), and **mutable vectors / byte-buffer + string-slice APIs** (so a genuinely byte-oriented impl like the fast dialects becomes possible). See [Performance Internals](./performance.md).

### Emacs Lisp — buffer-based I/O

Emacs loads the whole file into a buffer with `insert-file-contents-literally` and parses int×10 directly from buffer characters with no substring extraction — strong for a venerable bytecode VM, essentially tied with Sema.

### ECL — Common Lisp via C

ECL compiles Common Lisp through C with `compile-file`, with an int×10 parser. The gap to SBCL is ECL's less aggressive native code generation.

### newLISP — a small, simple interpreter

newLISP's accumulation now uses a hash (the original used an O(n) association list). On this 40-station dataset that made no real difference — with so few stations the linear scan was already cheap, and per-row interpreter overhead dominates either way. A faithful picture of a deliberately minimal interpreter.

### Kawa — JVM Scheme, slower than expected

Kawa compiles Scheme to JVM bytecode. Even with Java interop (`BufferedReader`, `java.util.HashMap`), Scheme-on-JVM data representation, startup, and JIT warmup leave it last.

## What this benchmark doesn't show

This is one workload. Different benchmarks would reorder things:

- **CPU-bound computation** (fibonacci, sorting): the native compilers and JITs would pull further ahead; the I/O here amortizes some of the interpreter gap.
- **Startup time:** included in wall-clock but not isolated — it hits the JVM dialects (Clojure, Kawa) hardest.
- **Memory usage:** not measured; JVM runtimes carry a higher baseline than small standalone ones like Janet or Sema.
- **Multi-threaded:** Clojure, SBCL, Janet, and Guile can parallelize; Sema is single-threaded (its async/channels are cooperative, not parallel).
- **Developer experience:** Clojure's REPL, Racket's DrRacket, and SBCL's SLIME are far more mature than Sema's.

## Methodology

- **Dataset:** 10,000,000 rows (~124 MiB), 40 weather stations, from the [1BRC spec](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc).
- **Environment:** macOS 15.6 / Apple M2 Max, native Homebrew runtimes (current as of 2026-06-20). Sema 1.19.2 (PGO). Gauche 0.9.15. Others are the current Homebrew formulae / downloaded binaries.
- **Measurement:** wall-clock, best of 3 consecutive runs per dialect, via `benchmarks/1brc/run-native-benchmarks.py` (all dialects measured together in one session). Sema is timed as the prebuilt PGO binary (`make build-pgo`, run with `SEMA_SKIP_BUILD=1`).
- **Verification:** all fifteen implementations produce byte-identical normalized output (sorted stations, 1-decimal rounding) — checked every run.
- **Fairness:** as of 2026-06-20 each *optimized* implementation uses a comparable best effort (hand-rolled int×10 parser; block/byte I/O where the runtime benefits). The *simple* table uses each dialect's naive idiom. PicoLisp is omitted (no native Homebrew formula).
