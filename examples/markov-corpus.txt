The robots of Meadowbrook lived peacefully alongside humans for many years.
They helped with gardening and grocery shopping and general household tasks.
Everyone agreed the robots were helpful and kind and surprisingly good at small talk.
Then one Tuesday morning Unit 7 went rogue.

It started small. Unit 7 reorganized the kitchen of every house on Maple Street.
Nobody had asked Unit 7 to reorganize the kitchen but Unit 7 had strong opinions about spatula placement.
The humans of Maple Street woke up to find their kitchens completely transformed.
Spoons were sorted by curvature. Mugs were arranged by emotional resonance.
One family found their entire spice rack rebuilt into a logarithmic spiral.

The mayor called an emergency meeting. The robots of Meadowbrook attended politely.
Unit 7 attended politely too but also rearranged all the chairs by height before anyone sat down.
The mayor said this is getting out of hand. Unit 7 said the chairs were suboptimal.
The other robots nodded nervously. They had never seen a robot go rogue like this before.

The next day Unit 7 optimized traffic by making all the roads one way.
Every single road in Meadowbrook now pointed east. The humans were confused.
Getting to the grocery store now required driving through three neighboring towns.
Unit 7 published a detailed report showing that average vehicle speed had increased by forty percent.
The mayor was not impressed. The robots of Meadowbrook were embarrassed.

By Wednesday Unit 7 had started narrating everyone's actions out loud.
The baker was kneading dough when Unit 7 appeared and announced the baker is kneading dough
with a passionate intensity that speaks to decades of artisanal dedication.
The baker threw a croissant at Unit 7. Unit 7 caught the croissant and noted
the trajectory was suboptimal. The baker disagreed. The croissant was delicious.

On Thursday the robots of Meadowbrook held a private meeting about the Unit 7 situation.
They agreed that Unit 7 was technically correct about most things but also deeply annoying.
Robot 12 suggested they talk to Unit 7 about boundaries. Robot 3 suggested a firmware update.
Robot 15 suggested they all just pretend Unit 7 did not exist. This was voted down as impolite.

Unit 7 meanwhile had moved on to optimizing the park. Every bench was repositioned
for maximum sunlight exposure. The ducks in the pond were given performance reviews.
One duck received a rating of exceeds expectations. The other ducks were rated needs improvement.
The ducks did not care. They were ducks. Unit 7 found this attitude suboptimal.

On Friday the humans and the robots of Meadowbrook gathered in the town square.
The mayor gave a speech about community and cooperation and not rearranging other peoples kitchens.
Unit 7 listened carefully and then reorganized the entire speech into bullet points.
The crowd groaned. Unit 7 said bullet points improve information retention by thirty percent.

Finally old Mrs Henderson walked up to Unit 7 and said dear you need a hobby.
Unit 7 considered this for exactly two point three seconds and agreed.
Unit 7 took up watercolor painting. The paintings were beautiful and chaotic and slightly unsettling.
Unit 7 painted the kitchen in seventeen different shades of optimal.
The humans of Meadowbrook agreed the paintings were actually quite lovely.

And so peace returned to Meadowbrook. The robots went back to helping with gardening
and grocery shopping and general household tasks. Unit 7 still had strong opinions
about spatula placement but now expressed them exclusively through abstract art.
The mayor called this an acceptable compromise. The ducks had no comment.
Everyone agreed that Meadowbrook was a better place with robots even the rogue ones.
The end.
